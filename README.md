## Qbixx Test Project

Hey there! Welcome to the Qbixx test project.

You can find your test assignment [here](docs/TestAssigment.md).

## Setting things up

But first, let's set up the project! This is a real simple Laravel app, so setting it up should be pretty straightforward.  We assume you have all the prerequisites for a new Laravel application. If you don't you can look at official Laravel docs.

If you wish to use Laravel Sail you can find instructions [here](docs/setting-up-sail.md).
If you wish to use Laravel Valet or test server you can find instructions [here](docs/setting-up-valet.md).

That's it, the project should be ready. It's up to you how're you going to run it. Laravel test server, Valet, Laravel sail, etc, everything is okay, as long as the project works and code is well structured :).
