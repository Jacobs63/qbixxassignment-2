## Qbixx Test Project

Hey there! Welcome to the Qbixx test project. You can find your test assignment here.
But first, let's set up the project!

This is a real simple Laravel app, so setting it up should be pretty straightforward.

We assume you have all the prerequisites for a new Laravel application. If you don't you can look at official Laravel docs. 

After that, you should run:
- composer install
- npm install
- npm run dev
- copy the .env.example to .env
- generate the APP key

Then the project should be ready. It's up to you how're you gonna run it. Laravel test server, Valet, Laravel sail, etc, everything is okay, as long as the project works and code is well structured :).
