## Qbixx Test Project

Hey there! Welcome to the Qbixx test project. You can find your test assignment [here](docs/TestAssigment.md).
But first, let's set up the project!

This is a real simple Laravel app, so setting it up should be pretty straightforward.

We assume you have all the prerequisites for a new Laravel application. If you don't you can look at official Laravel docs. 

After that, you should run:
- composer install
- npm install
- npm run dev
- copy the .env.example to .env
- generate the APP key

Then the project should be ready. It's up to you how're you going to run it. Laravel test server, Valet, Laravel sail, etc, everything is okay, as long as the project works and code is well structured :).

Note: .env.example is set to run on Laravel sail. If you tend to use something else, tweak it to your needs.
